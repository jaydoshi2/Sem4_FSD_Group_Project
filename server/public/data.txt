Guys, in this complete Java course with notes, I will tell you from the beginning to the end of Java chapter wise, we will see each topic with notes along with that, this course is going to be beginner friendly, if you are a beginner even if you have never done programming then also you can watch this course from the beginning to the end to master Java in this Java course, I will keep giving you notes of every chapter along with that, I will give you notes of every chapter and also in this video, I will give you an ultimate thing which will help you in doing java programming for life. So stay tuned in this video, I will give you that thing. But before that, first things first, I would like to install java for you. This course is going to be beginner friendly. Without wasting time, let's go inside the computer and there we'll see how we'll install Java so guys I'm inside my computer and now it's time to install Java we'll install Java we'll install JDK Java, Java Development Kit along with that we'll install IntelliJ Idea which will facilitate us in writing code it will make our life easier when we write code we will install that to download JDK I will open a new tab in my browser and I will type JDK download in Google search and as soon as I type JDK download I will get this page of oracle.com you have to open this page and after opening this page you will get the link to download JDK click on it and scroll down you will get a platform installer I am going to install windows x64 I clicked on it and it is asking me to accept my terms and conditions before downloading you accept and download it and it is asking if it is securedd yes i have allowed it because i am on the official website of oracle i know that this software is not going to harm me as soon as you download this software it will be downloaded in your downloads folder now execute it as soon as you execute it you will get a window installer if you are in windows, click on next it will show you a box again showing the status it took almost no time to install it will say that your java development kit is installed you just have to install it like any other simple software close it, my JDK is installed in my computer After this I am going to download an IDE When we run Java program JDK will help us in that. But to use JDK in an optimal and interactive way I have to download an IDE IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment you can use any IDE if you are experienced but if you are a beginner, then I would say type on Google Download IntelliJ IDEA now what is this IntelliJ IDEA see here it is written IntelliJ IDEA it is a professional IDE, you have to download its community version I repeat again, you have to download its community version, I repeat again, you have to download the community version, you don't have to download the ultimate version, because it has only 30 day trial, after that it will stop working, the work we are going to do in this video, in fact, in this whole course, it will work from our community, this downloading has started, my internet connection is a little fast, so you will see things downloading a little fast but if your internet connection is slow then you will download a little slow mine is downloading very fast so I will wait for it to download and as soon as it is downloaded, I will install it. Now your Java development kit will do most of the work for you whatever you will put in Java development, but this IDE with the help of this, your Java development work will be very easy okay, with that said, let's install it I open this exe and my exe is opening, as soon as will open this exe and this exe is opening for me. As soon as I open this exe and without messing around, I will click on next again. Next, next, next, next, you have to do it without messing around with anything. Just click on this add launchers dir to path because if you do this, then the development we are going to do in your future do will be easier just don't forget to check this and after clicking on next click on install and as soon as you click on install, it will take a little time to install I talk about the rest of the things while it is installing I want to show you the notes that I have made for you and with the help of which we will move this whole course forward when you do Java programming then this course forward when you will do Java programming then many things happen which you will forget so I have prepared a very ultimate thing for you which I am going to show you in a while let's talk a little about Java first Java was made by Sun Microsystems in 1991 and James Gosling who was one of the founders of Java he initially called it Oak he called it Oak and the goal of this language was to make a simple, portable and reliable language which was based on C and C++ but they removed some features from C and C++ which used to bother the developers they started the development of this language with the goal of making a good experience for developers this was the first application language of the world wide web which is a big achievement for java language now we will see how java program works but before that I want to show you those notes which I have made for you for this course you will get those notes so we will go inside our computer and see those notes so guys first of all I have made notes for you chapter wise so that whatever you are learning, you take notes with you if you take notes with you, then the most benefit you will get is that you will have a very ultimate thing for revision, which will be the notes of the java course. one more thing that I have to give you with this course is the cheat sheet of ultimate java, which I have made for you, now again, do not see it at all, it is only useful for you when you have an interview after a day or say you have an exam after a day I have written all these points at one place of java so that you can see it suddenly and recall things, okay? this is not at all something that java will teach you after reading it but you must have understood that this is such a thing which you can print out and stick it on your table, wall, anywhere so that you can see out and stick on your wall or table so that you can see it for quick reference so my goal here is to bring the best course and experience for you so that learning java becomes a very easy thing for you if you like the video then you must like it and also download the copy of these notes I have given the link in the description. I would like to talk about Java an object oriented programming language made by Sun Microsystems in US in 1991. James Gosling was one of the inventors of Java he made Java as a purely object oriented language which means that if you want to write a code in Java then you have to do object oriented programming which is also called OOPS you can't do procedural oriented programming which is called POP C++ is a language in which you can do POP you can do OOPS you can do whatever you want you can do both in future you can convert your pop program to oops program so in C++ this is the thing in java you have object oriented programming you have to make classes and how java works is a big question which i will tell you java is a compiled language or interpreted language? This is a question that is asked by many people and many places. So Java is a compiled language and an interpreted language. It is a compiled language because the source code of Java that you are going to write is compiled in the bytecode of Java. Once it is compiled in the bytecode of Java, then it is interpreted in a machine code so here is the process of compilation here is the process of interpretation so here is the Java compiled language and interpreted language if you are a beginner and you don't know much these things will make sense to you when we do a little programming but just for knowing sake, just for knowledge sake, I have made this thing for you we have done the installation of java, I have included these two points in the notes that in future if you want to do java even after 1-2 years and you have lost your mind then you can recall by seeing these notes that install JDK, I had written on google 2 years ago and had installed java, had installed IntelliJ IDEA so I have included these 2 points here What is JDK and what is JRE? This is a very important question and I will answer it for you What is JDK? JDK stands for Java Development Kit Kit used by developers so that they can make Java programs well So this is a collection of tools used for developing and running java programs what is java runtime environment? java runtime environment is needed to run any java application so helps in executing programs developed in java so this was a very good introduction of java i have planned a lot of things in future this cheat sheet is going to be very useful for you i will give download link of all of them in the description download your notes copy download this copy too and the notes i am going to give in future, download that too and i will give you the source code in the video along with that, i will upload these videos regularly and also regularly I will upload videos and take this course to the end so that you don't face any problem in learning java I hope you have understood this thing now we will move towards our intelligent idea and we will write our first java program so you guys from your desktop or you can click here type here to search and open your IntelliJ IDEA when you will open it for the first time it will say I confirm that I have read you can check it and click continue so when you open IntelliJ IDEA for the first time you will see some screen like this you guys have to click on new project so that you can create a new project after clicking on new project you will see this screen so first of all, project SDK you will see 14 automatically in some of the very rare cases if you are using windows 7 which I don't recommend at all sometimes you don't get selected and you have to add jdk but if you are on windows 10 your computer is fine 4gb ram is also fine your computer is fine if you don't have a 20-25 year old computer then your work will be done well I have selected 14 here click on next and then check create project from template and create command line app now see command line app is a very boring application in which we write bare minimum code and do something we are interested in GUI applications but for simple learning purpose we will first create command line application so that we can learn java once we learn java well, then we will make advanced apps so once we understand how to make logic how things work in java then we can explore more capabilities of java but at this point if you are a beginner or you don't know java well then you can select command line app and click on next and then give a name to your project I will give a name to my project first java program this is my first java program code with harry, I will write cwh in short first java program code with harry, I will write cwh in short first java program code with harry I have written in short you can give some other name, I have given this if you want to be very consistent give same name so that our things are same as we are doing work and once you know java then you can change name you can change everything click on finish and as you click on finish you will get Java, so you have to change the name also everything has to be changed, click on finish and when you click on finish, you will get this kind of code so this is our IntelliJ IDEA this is how our screen comes now if you are on windows, it is telling me that windows defender can impact your performance so you will click on exclude directory and click on configure automatically and give it access, so it will update your windows defender configuration as per your liking so that it can run properly, so I have allowed it because I trust IntelliJ IDEA, I know it won't do any nasty work in my computer, so I have given it access like this, now what we will do here we will go to file, go to settings if you are first time intelligent IDE or for any IDE if you are a beginner you have never opened any IDE then you guys don't worry at all you don't have to learn everything nor you have to remember anything I don't know what's in them so there is nothing to remember, I just knew this much, to be very honest, there are settings in the file, so I pulled the settings here, now there are many things here, you can change the theme, you can put a light theme, dark theme, you can take the theme of your choice, I like dark theme, I put dark, maybe you like light theme, there is no problem in it, you can use light theme, if you want to choose a custom font, any font if you want to use custom font or want to increase font size you can do all these things from here if I want to increase font size to 22 I will click on apply so font size has increased but I have increased it a little more so I think font size has increased a lot so font size has to be reduced a little 22 is too much let's make it 18, 18 should be fine, and here you can see the design but I will keep it normal, I will use font cui I will use this font so that things look fine, not too fancy you can use whatever font you want now when you click on editor and then click on general after editor click on general editor, general there will be an option change font size with control plus mouse wheel I like this option because after applying this and after clicking ok I can change my font with control and mouse wheel so if I want to zoom out I can change my font with the help of mouse wheel and control so if I want to zoom out, I can do it by pressing ctrl and zoom in and zoom out and I can work easily and I like this feature a lot that's why I keep it enabled now you have to write your first java code here so what you have to do here is follow me with the symbol you write here system.out.println and then write here hello world and we will write hello world only and here you write only hello world you don't have to write anything else just write hello world system.out.println is a function println which which is printing whatever you put in it you can understand it like this we don't have to think much about what is function, what is variable, what is string we don't have to think much, we have to see our program running and get some confidence from it that's what I want to do for you now so you click on this run main, you can see it on the top right run main click on this as soon as you click on this your program will run I clicked on this it will use your JDK it will automatically do all the command line operations and will present the output of the program to you so it has presented the hello world to me so whatever I do here, the output is shown below hello world, as you can see and congratulations, you have made your first java program so congratulations to you all and write congratulations in the comment box below i know very few people are going to write but all the people who will write i thank them from my heart and along with that i will give you my heart so guys that was it about this video i have just given you the introduction of java so guys at this point you have to take an action that if you are watching on computer then i have given the link in the description so guys what was it about this video so guys at this point you have to take an action if you are watching this video on computer i have given the link of java playlist in the description i have made a playlist of java playlist i will make a java playlist for you guys i will make a java playlist for you guys if you are watching on the computer, then don't watch the video now, take that playlist from the description below and open that playlist in the new tab, click here and bookmark it and click here and save it. You will have that playlist, you will not lose this course, this channel will not be lost. That's why I am saying that you guys bookmark it and save it in any way so that you guys can put it in future videos and upload notes you will get all that, work is on I have made these notes for you and this ultimate cheat sheet don't read it now I repeat don't read it now, just download it and keep it with you, this will be useful for you in future when your java will be complete, for now you just have to download it and keep it and the points in this are very to download it and keep it and the points in it are very useful save it and keep it so I hope you liked this Java course I have given you the link of the Java playlist below if you share that playlist so that would mean a lot to me if you share it on Instagram etc. so don't forget to tag me if you take screenshot and share it on Instagram so do tag me so that I can post your story again i will definitely post your story i will definitely post your story i will definitely post your story i will definitely post your story i hope you guys liked this video i hope you guys liked this video that's it for now download the notes thank you so much for watching this video and i will see you next time.
